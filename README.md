Did you encounter any problems in this challenge we should warn students about in the future? How can we make the challenge better?

	The instructions were a little unclear about how to store your data. The first time I read it I assumed we could only store all code from every page on one file. After I figured out we didn't have to, it was actually smoothe sailing though. In the future, briefly explaining what a CSV file is and what you can do with it might be nice (as in putting it in to a JSON file).

	Also, because we're working with data it might be helpful to review relative vs. absolute links.
